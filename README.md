This is my first Django mini project — a simple web-based To-Do List app where users can register, log in, and manage their personal tasks.

## Project Structure
- ```main/ ```– Handles the home page, view list, and create list views

- ```mysite/ ```– The root Django project folder that manages routing and settings

- ```register/``` – Handles user registration functionality


## How it works

1. Visit the home page.

2. If you're not logged in, you can only view limited pages.

3. To create and manage your own to-do list:

  - Register for an account or log in if you already have one.

  - Once logged in, you can create a new to-do list.

  - View your created lists and manage them as needed.

## Access Control
🔒 You must be logged in to:
